  <h1>Metaverse Petshop</h1>
  <p>
    Metaverse Petshop is an interactive installation which features digital “pets” displayed on a monitor inside real physical 
    metal cages accompanied with pet toys and water bowls. Visitors of this exhibit can use an interface on their smartphones to 
    adopt these virtual pets. If the pet wasn’t adopted within 10 minutes, the pets would disappear and a new one would be generated 
    in its place. Adopted pets can be converted into NFTs in a particular way for a longer life. By choosing to do this, it removes 
    the animal's 3D “skin” and converts it to a 2D image. It critiques the commodification and ethicality of how society treats animals, 
    whether digital life requires ethical considerations, and consumerist society. It invites the audience to reflect on how uncanny 
    it is that society has reached a stage where capitalist values (profit, ownership, and scarcity) now extend to the virtual realm, 
    where one can gain emotional attachment while also viewing and participating in the disposability of digital — and ultimately 
    “not real” — creations.
