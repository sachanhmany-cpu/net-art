  <h1>The Realm</h1>
  <p>
    Realm is a web-based artwork viewed through the user's computer or smartphone, in which two different versions can be seen. 
    When opened with a computer, words saying “You can’t touch there from your desktop” appear, and when done with your smartphone, 
    words saying “You can’t see there from your mobile” show at the bottom of the page. Images of natural landscapes and graves 
    phase in and out of the screen. This work conceptually depicts the limits of the digital realm, reminding the viewer that only 
    a part of reality can be experienced through screens. The contrast between nature (life) and cemeteries (death) in relation to 
    the internet can comment on how the digital realm can bring “life” and connect individuals while also being “dead” — people 
    cannot physically see or touch one another, thus losing that important physical component to genuine connection. This captures 
    a major conflict experienced by many during the pandemic, particularly when isolation, digital fatigue, and longing were at 
    their highest.
